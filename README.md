# Project Get_Placed 

Your helping hand during the woes of placements!

Every college senior goes through a stressful time during placement season. Our project helps ease some of that load by providing some clarity as to what the future may hold and how to deal with incoming problems. 

Get_Placed offers:
- Resume Parser: The resume parser parses through the resume entered by the user and returns the collected data. In the current age, companies receive a huge number of  resumes and hence it is necessary for one's resume to be machine readable. The parser can give an idea as to what data is read from the resume and users can edit the resume accordingly. 
- DSA Skill Test: DSA is an important part of coding interviews hence it is necessary to polish those skills and see how one performs. This DSA test accomplishes that by providing a testing experience to the user and informing them about their performance.
- Placement probability predictor: This predictor informs the user about the probability of them getting placed on campus and off campus using parameters like their grades, branch, location and many more. Machine learning models were used to predict the probability.

Tech Stack: Python, nltk, pyresparser, javascript, firebase, flask
